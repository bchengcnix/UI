## Documentation

### Basic Commands

- `npm start`
  - Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.
- `npm test`
  - Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode. By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.
- `npm run build`
  - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed.

## Dependencies to make developing easier

### Jest

Using this JavaScript Testing Framework to perform unit testing for now.

### Eslint

Using this linter to lint and analyze my code to maintain best practices.

### TypeScript

### Selenium
